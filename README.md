-  🦡 **Hi, I’m ***The Mongoose*****
- 🧠 I’m interested in learning ethical hacking and creatring useful tools for digital artists like myself
- 💻 currently my skill level is comletely novice although i have taught myself how to move around my Konsole pretty smoothly
- 🧑‍🎨 I’m not really looking to do much collaberation projects right now unless you need some digital art done then I'm your guy. Mainly just because i dont feel im in any position to chime in on the codespace. out of my element
- 🤙 How to reach me ... I'd say the best way is going to be email me @ lethal.form@proton.me
- or instagram for art projects [@forever_unfinished_art](https://www.instagram.com/forever_unfinished_art?igsh=OT3ODZmYW1qbmZn)
